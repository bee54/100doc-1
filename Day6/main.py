#In lieu of Day6 which is about commanding a robot around on reeborgsworld.com, I'm reviewing a bit of python identation


#1 space idented function 
def my_function():
 print("")
print("Nop")

#2 space idented function 
def my_function():
  print("")
print("Nop")

#3 space idented function 
def my_function():
   print("")
print("Nop")


# It doesnt even care that I have 3 functions named the same thing.


my_function()
