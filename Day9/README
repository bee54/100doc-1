Auction program collects participant names and bids and announces the highest bid.


Bug1 solved:
When user name is 0 and bid is <= 0, it says
"AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'name'"

Bug1 FIX by taking winningParticipant= gatheredParticipantList[0] if len(gatheredParticipantList)==1 else None

Bug 2 outstanding:
Participant can offer negative and 0 dollar bids.

Bug 3 outstanding:
Participant can win auctions with negative bids.
